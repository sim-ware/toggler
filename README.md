# Struggle with integrating SASS
I spent a lot of time trying to get React to work with SASS, including trying to run 'npm run eject' to show the webpack configurations, as well as installing a few packages. The Facebook documentation suggested using the 'npm install --save node-sass-chokidar' command and package, but I couldn't get them to work either. In order to make progress on the task I forewent using SASS for the time being, because it had already eaten up a lot of my time.

# Difficulty finishing
 at this stage I couldn't pass the contents of each Toggle to the parent MegaToggle Class. If I was able to, I would then have the string below dynamically change the word correct/incorrect depending on the selected choices. I lost a lot of time trying to get SASS to work - as it was specified I thought it was an integral part of the challenge, but unfortunately the time I lost on configuring it meant I was unable to progress on this task as I had hoped, as well as balancing other demands.
